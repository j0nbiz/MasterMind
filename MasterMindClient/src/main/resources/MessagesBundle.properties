how_to_text=When starting the game, you can change the answer key to a custom answer or a random answer.  Choose a number by clicking on its button on the right, then place it by clicking on a guess box.  If the key contains a zero, it will default to a random key.\nWhen guessing, the computer will return hints about each part of the current guess, in no particular order.  A zero means the guess was completely wrong, a one means the guess was correct for position and number, and a two means the guess had the correct number, but not the correct position.
